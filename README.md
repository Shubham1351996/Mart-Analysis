# Mart-Analysis

Mart is a small supermarket owned by Mr. Abhishek. He wants a dashboard where he can track how well Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold). He would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions. Mr. Abhishek assumes that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data. Abhishek also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.
